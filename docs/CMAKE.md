## Install CMake

### Linux, MacOS

```bash
sudo apt install cmake # replace 'apt' with your distro package manager
```

### Windows

Download the latest version at this [link](https://cmake.org/download/) and make sure to select the option "Add CMake to the system PATH for the current user" when asked by the installer.

### Note

You may need to change the version of CMake specified in the main `CMakeLists.txt` file to match the version you just installed.
